# ðŸš€ Firebase Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Firebase Hosting

Your app is ready to deploy! Here's how to get it live on the web:

### 1. **Login to Firebase** (One-time setup)
```bash
firebase login
```
This will open a browser window for you to authenticate with your Google account.

### 2. **Deploy Your App**
```bash
# Build the frontend
cd frontend && pnpm run build

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
cd .. && firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### 3. **Your App Will Be Live At:**
- **URL**: `https://world-operation.web.app`
- **Custom Domain**: You can add a custom domain in Firebase Console

## ðŸŽ¯ **What's Already Configured:**

âœ… **Firebase Hosting Config** (`firebase.json`):
- Serves from `frontend/dist` (production build)
- Single Page App routing (all routes â†’ index.html)
- Optimized caching for JS/CSS files
- Project ID: `world-operation`

âœ… **Production Build**:
- TypeScript compiled
- Vite optimized bundle
- Minified and compressed
- Ready for production

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Commands:**

```bash
# Full deployment (build + deploy)
npm run deploy

# Just build
cd frontend && pnpm run build

# Just deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Deploy with preview
firebase hosting:channel:deploy preview
```

## ðŸ”§ **Performance Optimizations:**
